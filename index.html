      <p>Intelligent Weather anomaly detection - Mungaru Male</p>

<p>In recent years, many solutions to intelligent weather forecast have been proposed, especially on temperature and rainfall, however, it is difficult to simulate the meteorological phenomena and the corresponding characters of weather when some complex differential equations and computational algorithms are merely piled up. On the basis of the review of researches on the non-linear characters of meteorology.</p>

<p>Project "Mungaru Male" is a intelligent weather anomalies prediction system which will help analyze the deviations in weather patterns from the previous history.</p>
